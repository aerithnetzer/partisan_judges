The ZHB\u2019s July 27, 2017 decision purportedly granted in\npart, and denied in part the validity challenge filed by AFE to the Township\u2019s\nzoning ordinance (Zoning Ordinance), which contains conflicting provisions\nregulating billboards. See Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 28a-212a. AFE seeks site-\nspecific relief as to three conditional use applications.      The Township seeks\nreversal, asserting that the ZHB lacked jurisdiction to hear the validity challenge;\nalternatively, the Township argues that the ZHB\u2019s interpretation of the Zoning\nOrdinance reflects an error of law. For the following reasons, we vacate and\nremand.\n\n\n                                    Background\n               In 2006, the Township adopted Ordinance 108. R.R. at 526a-638a.\nSection 1 of Ordinance 108 states that Ordinance 21 of 1992 (the 1992 Ordinance),\nas amended, is hereby \u201cre-enacted and amended as indicated below in Section 2\nand Section 3.\u201d R.R. at 526a-27a. Section 2 of Ordinance 108 amends the 1992\nOrdinance to include \u201cadditional revised definitions, incorporation of new\nadditional zoning districts, inclusion of additional conditional use conditions, [and]\namended signage regulations . . . as set forth in Attachment A.\u201d\n               Attachment A contains standards for specific uses. Relevant here,\nSection 1102.XX Billboards (amended) states in part that billboards are not\npermitted within the R-1 and R-2 residential zoning districts or within 500 feet of a\nschool property. Under this provision, the size of a sign face is restricted to 750\nsquare feet.\n               Section 3 of Ordinance 108 re-enacts and amends the Township\nZoning Map per Attachment B. Section 4 of Ordinance 108 states that the 1992\n\n\n                                          2\n\fOrdinance, \u201cas further amended by this Ordinance 108, shall be integrated and\nincorporated into an updated, comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, as codified in\nChapter 175 of the Code of the [Township] as set forth in Attachment \u2018C\u2019.\u201d R.R.\nat 527a.\n                Attachment C2 is a draft ordinance. It includes two separate articles\nthat expressly regulate billboards. The first, Article XI (related to standards and\ncriteria for conditional uses and uses by special exception) incorporates in part the\nregulations in Attachment A, \u00a71102.XX Billboards (amended).                    Specifically,\nArticle XI, Section 1102.3(1) provides in part that billboards shall not be erected\nwithin the AG-A and AG-B agricultural zoning districts, and the R-1 and R-2\nresidential zoning districts, or within 500 feet of a school. Article XI, Section\n1102.3(2) states that a billboard shall have a maximum allowable gross surface\narea of 750 square feet per sign face. R.R. at 585a-86a.\n                Also set forth in Attachment C, Article XIV (related to signs)3 states\nthat billboards are subject to the requirements of Article XI governing conditional\nuses: \u201cA permit for a billboard shall not be issued until the conditional use\napplication has been granted by the Township Supervisors, provided all of the\nfollowing requirements are met: . . . billboards shall not be erected within 500 feet\nof a [school], Place of Worship or cemetery . . . .\u201d Section 1406.1(a) of the Zoning\nOrdinance, R.R. at 620a-21a. Additionally, Section 1406.1 states that billboards\nmay be authorized only in the C-2 and I-1 districts. R.R. at 621a. Further, under\nSection 1406.2 of the draft ordinance, a billboard shall have a maximum allowable\n\n       2\n           R.R. at 545a-638a.\n\n       3\n         A billboard is defined as a \u201csign displaying changeable advertising copy\u201d in Section\n175-8 of the Zoning Ordinance. R.R. at 33a.\n\n\n                                             3\n\fgross area of 450 square feet per sign face. R.R. at 621a. Lastly, Section 5 of\nOrdinance 108 provides that \u201cAll Ordinances or parts of Ordinances in conflict\nwith the provisions of this Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of such\nconflict.\u201d R.R. at 527a.\n             In the codified Zoning Ordinance, Article XI provisions regarding\nstandards and criteria for conditional uses and uses by special exception are found\nat Chapter 175, Article XI, Section 175-98 (Billboards). R.R. at 103a-105a. The\nprovisions in Article XIV regarding Signs are found at Section 175-165\n(Billboards). R.R. at 163a-66a.\n\n\n                               Procedural History\n             On May 25, 2016, AFE filed three conditional use applications with\nthe Township Board of Supervisors (Township Supervisors) to construct a\nbillboard on each of three parcels of land in the Township. In completing the\napplications, AFE chose the most favorable criteria from among the conflicting\nordinance provisions. On the same date, AFE filed a \u201cprotective\u201d substantive\nvalidity challenge with the ZHB, R.R. at 217a-47a, seeking a declaration that the\nrelevant ordinance provisions are invalid as being inconsistent and site-specific\nrelief permitting construction of the billboards in accordance with the least\nrestrictive provisions. R.R. at 247a. On May 26, 2016, the Township Manager\nreturned the conditional use applications as incomplete. R.R. at 291a-300a.\n             AFE unsuccessfully sought a meeting with Township Supervisors to\nclarify the inconsistent provisions. R.R. at 237a. The validity challenge before the\nZHB was continued by agreement of the parties, but no settlement was reached.\nThe ZHB held two public hearings, and the parties submitted briefs on their\n\n\n                                         4\n\frespective positions.     AFE offered no witnesses, viewing the facial validity\nchallenge as raising only questions of law. The Township submitted the testimony\nof Andrew Schwartz, of Environmental Planning and Design, concerning the\nhistory and development of the Township\u2019s billboard regulations. While the ZHB\nfound Schwartz\u2019s testimony credible, the ZHB agreed with AFE that the issues\npresented were primarily legal questions and the relevant facts were not in dispute.\n             The ZHB rejected the Township\u2019s argument that the ZHB lacked\njurisdiction and that the matter should proceed to review before the Planning\nCommission and Township Supervisors.              The ZHB was persuaded by AFE\u2019s\ncontentions that the conflicting ordinance provisions made it impossible for AFE to\ndetermine what standards apply for purposes of completing its conditional use\napplications. \u201cBefore it moves forward with its application[s], [AFE] should be in\na position to know how the zoning ordinance will be interpreted.\u201d ZHB\u2019s decision\nat 3. Relying on Section 916.1(a)(1) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning\nCode (MPC),4 the ZHB concluded that it had jurisdiction to hear the validity\nchallenge.\n             The ZHB then identified three issues presented.                 The first issue\ninvolves front yard setbacks. Under Section 175-98, the minimum front yard\nsetback is the same as the setback for a principal use. In the C-2 district, that\n\n\n      4\n        Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, as amended, added by the Act of December 21, 1988,\nP.L. 1329, 53 P.S. \u00a710916.1(a)(1). It states:\n\n             (a) A landowner who, on substantive grounds, desires to challenge\n             the validity of an ordinance or map or any provision thereof which\n             prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he\n             has an interest shall submit the challenge either: (1) to the zoning\n             hearing board under section 909.1(a) . . . .\n\n                                              5\n\fwould be 75 feet. Under Section 175-165, no front yard setback can be closer than\n10 feet to any public street. The second issue relates to the zoning districts in\nwhich billboards are permitted. Under Section 175-98, billboards are permitted in\nall but the AG-A, AG-B, R-1 and R-2 districts. In Section 175-165, billboards are\npermitted only in the C-1 and C-2 districts. The final issue recognized by the ZHB\nconcerns the size of the sign facing. Under Section 175-98, sign faces can measure\n750 square feet, whereas Section 175-165 limits the size of a sign face to 450\nsquare feet. Findings of Fact, Nos. 17-21.\n               AFE argued that because there are irreconcilable differences between\nZoning Ordinance provisions, AFE must be allowed to utilize the lesser restriction.\nSee Section 603.1 of the MPC.5 The Township asserted that, consistent with the\nevolution of the Zoning Ordinance, Section 175-98 applies to all billboards\nauthorized by conditional use or special exception, while Section 175-165 applies\nto all billboards that existed prior to the adoption of Section 175-98. The ZHB did\nnot address these arguments. Instead, the ZHB offered an interpretation of the\nOrdinance.\n               In doing so, the ZHB first noted that the language of an ordinance\nmust be given its plain meaning. Speilvogel, Inc. v. Cheltenham Township, 601\nA.2d 1310, 1317 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1992). The ZHB then concluded:\n\n\n      5\n          Added by the Act of December 21, 1988, P.L. 1329, 53 P.S. \u00a710603.1. It states:\n\n               In interpreting the language of zoning ordinances to determine the\n               extent of the restriction upon the use of the property, the language\n               shall be interpreted, where doubt exists as to the intended meaning\n               of the language written and enacted by the governing body, in\n               favor of the property owner and against any implied extension of\n               the restriction.\n\n                                                6\n\f              27. The plain meaning of Sections 1 and 2 of Ordinance\n              [] 108 is that Attachment \u201cA,\u201d and in this particular\n              matter, Attachment \u201cA\u201d pertaining to billboards amends\n              all existing prior ordinance provisions as to billboards.\n\n              28. The plain meaning of Section 5 of Ordinance [] 108\n              is that all ordinances in conflict with the ordinance\n              provisions in Attachment A \u00a71102.XX pertaining to\n              billboards, whether in former ordinance sections 1406.1\n              or [new] 1102.3 (both attached to Ordinance 108 as\n              \u201cAttachment C\u201d) are repealed to the extent of any\n              conflict with Attachment A.\n\n              29. Thus, the billboard provisions in \u00a71102.XX of\n              Attachment A to Ordinance 108 are controlling over\n              codification \u00a7175-98 (Attachment C to Ordinance 108,\n              \u00a71102.3) or [\u00a7175-1656] (Attachment C to Ordinance\n              108, \u00a71406-1) to the extent of any conflict.\n\n                                           ***\n\n              37. To the extent \u00a71102.XX is accurately codified in the\n              Codification as [\u00a7175.98] then that section controls \u00a7175-\n              165. If there is doubt or confusion, then the parties must\n              return to Ordinance 108, \u00a71102.XX\n\nZHB\u2019s Conclusions of Law Nos. 27-29, 37.\n              AFE and the Township appealed to the trial court, which heard\nargument but did not take additional evidence. By order dated September 25,\n2018, the trial court affirmed the ZHB\u2019s decision. In its Rule 1925(a) opinion, the\ntrial court identified, but did not address, the appellate claims raised by the parties.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         The ZHB references Section 175-88, but the Reproduced Record indicates that Sections\n175-82 to 175-91 are reserved. See R.R. at 97a. The codified provisions in Article XIV\nregarding Signs are found in Section 175-165 (Billboards).\n\n\n                                             7\n\f               On appeal to this Court,7 AFE seeks a declaration that the inconsistent\nprovisions of the Zoning Ordinance are invalid and the grant of site-specific relief,\nor a declaration that the provisions are inconsistent and must be interpreted in\nAFE\u2019s favor. The Township seeks a reversal of the ZHB\u2019s decision on the basis\nthat the ZHB lacked jurisdiction.8                  Alternatively, the Township seeks a\ndetermination by this Court adopting the Township\u2019s preferred interpretation of the\ncodified Zoning Ordinance.\n\n\n                                          Discussion\n               AFE first argues that the conflicting standards in two irreconcilable\nordinance provisions are not comprehensible by a person of ordinary intelligence,\nand, therefore, are unconstitutionally vague. Vague ordinances violate due process\nbecause they \u201cdo not give fair notice to people of ordinary intelligence that their\ncontemplated activity may be unlawful . . . .\u201d                    Scurfield Coal, Inc. v.\nCommonwealth, 582 A.2d 694, 697 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1990). Additionally, because\nvague ordinances do not set reasonably clear guidelines for law officials and\ncourts, they invite arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Id. See also Fisher v.\n\n       7\n          Where, as here, the trial court takes no additional evidence, our scope of review is\nlimited to determining whether the ZHB committed an abuse of discretion or an error of law.\nTaliaferro v. Darby Township Zoning Hearing Board, 873 A.2d 807, 811 n.1 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n2005).\n\n       8\n         In fact, the Township acknowledges that the ZHB has jurisdiction to hear a substantive\nvalidity challenge, but the Township contends that the application submitted to the ZHB was\nincorrectly labeled as such. According to the Township, the dispute between AFE and the\nTownship involves the interpretation and application of the Ordinance, which should be resolved\nby the Township Supervisors after hearings on AFE\u2019s conditional use applications. While the\nTownship characterizes the issues as involving an interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance, it fails\nto acknowledge the ambiguity therein.\n\n\n                                                8\n\fViola, 789 A.2d 782, 787 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2001) (an ordinance is unconstitutionally\nvague and violates due process when persons of common intelligence must guess\nat its meaning).\n             In Boron v. Pulaski Township Board of Supervisors, 960 A.2d 880,\n886 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2008), this Court explained:\n\n             Ordinances are presumed to be constitutional, and a\n             heavy burden is placed on a party seeking to challenge\n             the constitutionality of an ordinance. Commonwealth of\n             Pennsylvania v. Ebaugh, 783 A.2d 846, 849 (Pa.\n             Cmwlth. 2001). However, legislation that does not\n             establish its prohibition in explicit terms may be set aside\n             as unconstitutionally vague. Due process requires that a\n             statute give fair warning of its prohibition, as has been\n             explained by the United States Supreme Court:\n                   It is a basic principle of due process that an\n                   enactment is void for vagueness, if its prohibitions\n                   are not clearly defined. Vague laws offend several\n                   important values. First, because we assume that\n                   man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful\n                   conduct, we must insist that laws give the persons\n                   of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to\n                   know what is prohibited, so that he may act\n                   accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by\n                   not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary\n                   and indiscriminat[e] enforcement is to be\n                   prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for\n                   those who apply them . . . .\n\n             Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09\n             [(1972)]. In short, an enactment that requires men of\n             common intelligence to guess at its meaning violates due\n             process.\n             We agree with AFE. The Zoning Ordinance provisions that expressly\nregulate billboards irreconcilably conflict in material respects, including minimum\n\n\n                                          9\n\ffront yard setbacks, the districts in which billboards are permitted, and the\npermitted size of the billboard face. The ZHB did not acknowledge the conflicting\ncriteria in Sections 175-98 and 175-165, but nevertheless attempted to resolve the\nconflicts. To the extent the Township now challenges the ZHB\u2019s interpretation, its\nargument also reflects the ambiguity in the Zoning Ordinance.\n            AFE next argues that the ZHB erred in determining that the repealing\nclause in Ordinance 108, Section 5 (repealed) conflicts within Articles XI and XIV\nof the Zoning Ordinance while simultaneously enacting them. AFE observes that\nthe stated purpose of Ordinance 108 is to \u201cre-enact all previous Zoning Ordinances\nwith the amendments set forth below and to codify the same in Chapter 175 . . . .\u201d\nR.R. at 526a.\n            AFE argues that the following reasoning is consistent with that\npurpose: Section 1 of Ordinance 108 re-enacted and amended the 1992 Ordinance,\nincluding the billboard provisions that were codified as Section 175-165. Section 2\nof Ordinance 108 amended the 1992 Ordinance, adding, inter alia, provisions set\nforth in draft amendments attached to Ordinance 108 as Attachment A, which were\nnumbered as Section 1102.XX of the draft and became Section 175-98 in the\nconsolidated Ordinance. Section 3 re-enacted the Township Zoning Map. Section\n4 integrated and incorporated the prior, new and amended provisions into a\ncomprehensive zoning ordinance in Chapter 175 of the Township Code, as\nreflected in Attachment C. Finally, Section 5, referred to as the repealer clause,\nrepealed all ordinances \u201cin conflict with the provisions of this Ordinance . . . .\u201d\nR.R. at 526a-27a. AFE maintains that, logically, the term \u201cthis Ordinance\u201d refers\nto Ordinance 108. AFE argues that the ZHB relies on a tortured interpretation of\n\n\n\n\n                                        10\n\fOrdinance 108, which results in a re-enactment and repeal of the same provisions.\nWe agree.\n              As AFE correctly notes, the ZHB\u2019s conclusions ignore Attachment C,\nthe final codification of Chapter 175. The ZHB\u2019s suggestion that application of\nOrdinance 108 resolves this matter also ignores that Chapter 175 does not include a\nrepealer clause. We agree that the repealing clause of Ordinance No. 108 did not\neliminate the conflicts that currently exist in the Zoning Ordinance.\n              AFE also argues that the ZHB acted ultra vires in interpreting the\nZoning Ordinance. The ZHB\u2019s authority to decide a validity challenge is limited\nby Section 916.1 of the MPC to determining whether the challenge has merit, and,\nif so, to include recommended amendments to the challenged provision that will\ncure the defects found. AFE correctly notes that a validity challenge does not seek\nclarification of conflicting ordinance provisions,9 but only asks the ZHB to\ndetermine whether a person of common intelligence would have to guess at their\nmeaning \u2013 an issue the ZHB did not address.\n              Section 916.1 of the MPC authorizes a landowner to challenge the\nvalidity of a local ordinance on substantive grounds before the ZHB. Where a\nvalidity challenge is brought before a zoning hearing board, the MPC provides:\n\n              Based upon the testimony presented at the hearing or\n              hearings, the governing body or the zoning board, as the\n              case may be, shall determine whether the challenged\n              ordinance . . . is defective, as alleged by the landowner.\n              . . . If a challenge heard by a zoning hearing board is\n              found to have merit, the decision of the zoning hearing\n\n       9\n           For that reason, we do not address AFE\u2019s argument challenging the ZHB\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Zoning Ordinance, or the Township\u2019s arguments in support of its suggested\ninterpretation.\n\n\n                                              11\n\f             board shall include recommended amendments to the\n             challenged ordinance which will cure the defects found.\nSection 916.1(c)(5) of the MPC, 53 P.S. \u00a710916.1(c)(5) (emphasis added). The\nZHB fashioned an interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance, but it did not determine\nthe merit of AFE\u2019s substantive validity challenge. The ZHB\u2019s efforts to reconcile\nthe conflicting ordinance provisions exceeded the ZHB\u2019s authority to determine\nwhether the validity challenge had merit.\n             Finally, we address AFE\u2019s requests for either site-specific relief or a\ndeclaration that the challenged ordinance provisions are inconsistent and must be\ninterpreted in AFE\u2019s favor.        A party that successfully challenges a zoning\nrestriction cannot be denied site-specific relief if the challenger complies with the\nremaining valid portions of the regulations. Casey v. Zoning Hearing Board of\nWarwick Township, 328 A.2d 464, 469 (Pa. 1974). The ZHB has the authority and\njurisdiction to initially consider AFE\u2019s request for site-specific relief.\n             In Adams Outdoor Advertising, Ltd. v. Hanover Township Zoning\nHearing Board, 633 A.2d 240, 245 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1993), we observed:\n\n             Casey requires that a successful challenger to a zoning\n             ordinance be granted the relief requested unless the\n             government unit proves that the proposed use will be\n             injurious to the public health, safety, and welfare.\n             Casey[, 328 A.2d at 469,] considered:\n\n                    [W]hether a court has the power to grant an\n                    applicant-challenger definitive relief upon\n                    rendering       a      zoning       ordinance\n                    constitutionally infirm. . . . \u201cObviously, if\n                    judicial relief of local zoning action is to\n                    result in anything more than a farce, the\n                    courts must be prepared to go beyond mere\n                    invalidation and grant definitive relief.\u201d To\n                    forsake      a    challenger\u2019s     reasonable\n                    development plan after all the time, effort\n                                           12\n\f                        and capital invested in such a challenge is\n                        grossly inequitable . . . .\n                 However, we explained that an approval of a successful challenger\u2019s\nplan is not automatic; the suitability of the proposed site and various health and\nsafety considerations must be considered. Id. The municipality in Adams Outdoor\nAdvertising, Ltd. failed to provide any record evidence demonstrating that the\nchallenger\u2019s plan, if allowed, would be injurious to the public health, safety,\nwelfare, and morals. Relying on Casey, we reversed the trial court\u2019s order and\nremanded the matter to the zoning hearing board with instructions to issue the\nchallenger a permit to construct the sign as proposed. 633 A.2d at 245-46.\n                 However, neither this Court nor the ZHB can provide AFE site-\nspecific relief. We hold that AFE is entitled to application of the most favorable\nreconciliation of the challenged conflicting Zoning Ordinance provisions. To the\nextent that billboards are allowed as conditional uses under the Zoning Ordinance,\nthe Township Supervisors consider such applications. Our holding herein does not\nrelieve AFE of the need to re-submit its conditional use applications to that body.10\n                 Accordingly, we vacate the trial court\u2019s order and remand the matter\nto permit AFE to re-submit its conditional use applications for consideration and\ndisposition by the Township Supervisors.11\n\n\n\n                                              MICHAEL H.
